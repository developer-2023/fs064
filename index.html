            Cascade/cascading is a set of rules that solve conflicts of CSS.
            Cascade takes into consideration:
            1. Source of CSS (external file, file, user settings of web browser)
            2. Specificity of selectors - medal classification (Gold, Silver, Brown)
            3. Order in CSS
